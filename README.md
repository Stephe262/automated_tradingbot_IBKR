# automated_tradingbot_IBKR
I have created a trading bot through IBKR that aligns with my trading strategy and can execute buy, sell, short orders in accordance to my strategy with a click of a button.

After the strategy has been completed I am notified via Slack on what was purchased/sold and quantities of those transactions.
