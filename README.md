# automated_tradingbot_IBKR
I have created a trading bot through IBKR that aligns with my trading strategy and can execute buy, sell, short orders in accordance to my strategy with a click of a button.

I use Genovest as a backtesting platform to hone in my strategies and receive a daily email from their platform notifying me what to buy/sell. The bot will parse these emails and pull out ticker info and according to my strategies buy/short certain stocks.

After the strategy has been completed I am notified via Slack on what was purchased/sold and quantities of those transactions.
